The 3D model in Blender was crafted as part of a project for a Computer Graphics course. The assignment involved creating a scenario of our choosing using 2D or 3D objects. Designing the island model and its components provided an excellent opportunity to blend technical and creative skills, while also delving into valuable concepts like geometry, composition, and aesthetics.

Given the enriching experience of the project, I sought to extend its immersive potential by enabling user interaction through a 3D website. This repository contains the code associated with the project.
